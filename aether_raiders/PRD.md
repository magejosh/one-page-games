## Product Requirements Document — Aether Empires ("Aether Raiders")

### 1) Vision
Create a one‑page, instantly playable 4X that blends the readability and tempo of RTS with the planning clarity of turn‑based play. Keep the scope tight: a beautiful canvas galaxy, a small tech tree, lightweight combat, and two clear win paths (science and domination).

### 2) Goals & Non‑Goals
- Goals
  - Deliver a complete 4X "micro‑campaign" in a single HTML file (no assets).
  - Support both real‑time and turn‑based playstyles (either via a toggle or separate builds).
  - Make strategic choices readable: range‑limited movement, visible hyperlanes, explicit colony focus/policies.
  - Provide at least one explicit victory condition (Science via Ascension Gate) and trackable Domination.
- Non‑Goals
  - Deep colony simulation (districts, population jobs, trade routes).
  - Multiplayer or networked play.
  - Modding / save‑load system in initial scope.

### 3) Target Audience
- Players who enjoy classic 4X (MoO, Alpha Centauri) but want a short, self‑contained session (15–30 minutes).
- Game jam and web toy enthusiasts; designers seeking reference for minimal 4X implementations.

### 4) Core Gameplay Loops
- Explore → Expand → Exploit → Exterminate
  1. Select starting colony, build Scout/Colony/Frigate.
  2. Send ships along range‑limited jumps (hyperlanes drawn for spatial clarity).
  3. Found colonies, accumulate resources, pick research and policies.
  4. Skirmish at stars; flip ownership; push toward victory.

- Victory Loops
  - Science: research Ascension Theory → pay resources → build Ascension Gate → complete progress bar → win.
  - Domination: control all enemy‑owned stars (explicit check TBD).

### 5) Feature Set (MVP → Polished)
- MVP (implemented across 01–03)
  - Procedural galaxy, hyperlanes, DPI‑aware canvas rendering.
  - Empires (player + AIs), simple AI expansion/raids.
  - Three ship types; range‑limited travel; star‑localized skirmishes.
  - Colony stocks and ship build queues.
  - Research tree of 6 techs; global policies (3 categories).
  - Science victory via Ascension Gate project.
  - UI: left/right/bottom bars; tooltips and overlays.

- Polished/Advanced (planned)
  - Explicit Domination victory check and end‑screen.
  - Difficulty presets (AI aggression/economy multipliers).
  - Event pips/messages with subtle icons; improved message backlog.
  - Audio cues (web‑safe beeps) with mute toggle.
  - Accessibility: color‑blind friendly palette toggle; larger UI scale option.
  - Optional seed entry for reproducible galaxies.

### 6) Systems Detail
- Galaxy
  - 36–68 stars depending on map size. Each star has resource richness (metal, crystal, aether), growth, and name.
  - Hyperlanes generated by k‑nearest neighbors.

- Empires & Species
  - Global multipliers (range/damage/HP/prod/growth/research/res yields); species add small differentiators (03).

- Economy
  - Per‑colony stocks accumulate per tick/turn; costs are paid upfront when starting builds.
  - Colony Focus (03): Balanced, Production, Research, Growth tweak multipliers.

- Combat
  - At‑star, simultaneous fire; all‑vs‑all targeting; ownership flips when one side remains.

- Research & Policies
  - Research selection queues a target; overflow retained at reduced rate when unfocused.
  - Policies: single pick per category; local overrides provide small per‑colony bonuses (02/03).

- Abilities
  - Chrono Surge (01/02): local/global cooldown; speeds build/research for a short duration at a chosen colony.

### 7) UX & Controls
- Real‑time build (01): Space pause; R/P/H quick access; bottom bar actions per selection.
- Hybrid build (02): Wheel zoom; right‑drag pan; T toggle turns; E end turn; colony panel with queue and local policies.
- Turn‑based build (03): Start/setup (AI count, map size, turn length, species); E end turn; colony Focus controls.

### 8) Technical Requirements
- Single HTML file per iteration; no external dependencies.
- Canvas 2D rendering; clamp DPR to ≤2 for perf; avoid reflow thrash; minimize allocations per frame.
- Runs in latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox desktop.

### 9) Success Metrics
- Time‑to‑fun < 30 seconds from page load.
- Average session length 10–30 minutes.
- Win rates: Science ~40–60% for new players on Standard with 2 AIs; Domination achievable but longer.

### 10) Milestones
- M0 (done): RT 4X mini with science victory, basic AI, policies/tech, Chrono Surge.
- M1 (done): Camera + optional turns; colony panel; local policy overrides.
- M2 (done): Full turn‑based build with setup; species; colony focus.
- M3 (next): Domination victory condition + end‑screen; difficulty presets; message UX pass.
- M4 (stretch): Accessibility palette/scale; seedable maps; minimal SFX.

### 11) Open Questions / Risks
- Balance of species perks and Focus breakpoints across map sizes.
- AI pathing/goal selection on sparse maps (K‑nearest network quirks).
- Performance at large star counts on low‑end devices.
