# One Page Games 🎮

A collection of small, self-contained **one-page games** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
Each game lives entirely in a single HTML file (with optional inline CSS/JS), making them easy to share, remix, or drop into your own projects.

These are quick experiments, prototypes, and fun little time-wasters — perfect for learning, inspiration, or just playing around.

## 📂 Structure

* **Each game** has its own folder or file.
* Assets (if any) are included alongside the HTML file for portability.
* All games are written to run in the browser — no installs, no build tools required.
