### Core features
- **Resource foraging & production**: Gather wood, food, stone, clay, and flax by hand, then automate via Woodcutter Huts, Farms, Quarries, and more.
- **Grid-based building**: Place structures on a 48√ó30 tile map; housing increases population capacity; specialized buildings convert goods (e.g., Loom, Workshop, Bakery).
- **Time, seasons, and happiness**: Day/night cycle with four seasons modifying farm yields; happiness affects growth and can be boosted by Inns or harmed by starvation.
- **Population & tiers**: Grow from Hamlet I to Borough IV by meeting resource and population milestones.
- **Knowledge & tech tree**: Earn üìú knowledge from Schools or the Chief‚Äôs Longhouse and spend it on technologies that unlock new buildings or bonuses (Masonry, Trade Guilds, Stone Roads, etc.).
- **Random events**: Quarries may uncover iron or gold; the Chief‚Äôs Longhouse may share extra lore.
- **Camera & minimap**: Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, and use the minimap to jump around the settlement.
